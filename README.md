# Prework Study Guide

## Description

I wanted to create a simple web application to use as a study gudie for the conding Bootcamp. The idea of building a web application for this purpose provided great practice prior to the course as well as the convience of accessing my study guide from any browser. This shoudl allow for greater organization as I study during the course. Along the way, I learned some great basci information about Git, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Futher, I had an oppurtunity to get comfortable using VS Code and GitHub.
